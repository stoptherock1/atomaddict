\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Atomaddict} is a project, designed to simplify access to information. In the environment full of different sorts of information the fastest way to collect only information you are interested in is to have tool, which will know your needs and will automatically gather actual information for you, so you are always up-to-date in everything you are interested in.

The main goal of the \textbf{Atomaddict} project was to create a narrow-purpose tool with a low entry barrier, nice interface and modular architecture, available for any user regardless of operating system or device type. 

% \paragraph{Outline}
% The remainder of this document is organized as follows.
% Section~\ref{previous work} gives account of previous work.
% Our new and exciting results are described in Section~\ref{results}.
% Finally, Section~\ref{conclusions} gives the conclusions.

\section{Project goals}\label{project goals}
The aim of the project is to create a web application, which aggregates syndicated web content, such as online newspapers, blogs or podcasts. User will receive information and news based on his own preferences, that is, he will be able to choose topics or particular websites and subscribe to the groups of RSS and Atom feeds. 
The second goal was creating a tool, which will be easy to use regardless of target platform or users skill in IT applications. \textbf{Atomaddict} has simple intuitive interface and customizable functionality, which is supposed to satisfy any user expectations.
The application is useful either for new and for hard users. We have achieved it by creating two kinds of views â€“- simple title look-like view and more advanced table view. The principles of the User Interface are nice flexible design, which will look fine on any sort of display, and extremely narrowed functionality, which will allow user to be focused on main application features and not be bothered by useless buttons and clumsy bars.

\section{Project management}\label{project management}
To make work on the \textbf{Atomaddict} project efficient and multitask we took an advice from the project coordinator and used several additional tools as GitHub (\url{https://github.com}) and Trello (\url{https://trello.com}). Also Gantt diagram was used to plan the workflow.


%--------------------------------------------SUBSECTION--------------------------------------------
\subsection{GitHub}
GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as wikis, task management, and bug tracking and feature requests for every project.

GitHub offers both plans for private repositories and free accounts, which are usually used to host open-source software projects. As of 2015, GitHub reports having over 9 million users and over 21.1 million repositories, making it the largest code hoster in the world.

GitHub is mostly used for code.
In addition to source code, GitHub supports the following formats and features:


\begin{itemize}

\item Documentation, including automatically-rendered README files in a variety of Markdown-like file formats (see README files on GitHub)

\item Issue tracking (including feature requests)

\item Wikis

\item Small websites can be hosted from public repositories on GitHub. The URL format is \url{http://username.github.io}

\item Nested task-lists within files

\item Visualization of geospatial data

\item Gantt charts

\item 3D render files which can be previewed using a new integrated STL file viewer which displays the files on a 3D canvas. The viewer is powered by WebGL and Three.js

\item Photoshop's native PSD format can be previewed and compared to previous versions of the same file.~\cite{wiki:github}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trello}
Trello is a free web-based project management application originally made by Fog Creek Software in 2011, that spun out to be its own company in 2014.
It operates a freemium business model, as well as being cross-subsidized by other Fog Creek Software products. A basic service is provided free of charge, though a Business Class paid-for service was launched in 2013.

Trello uses the kanban paradigm for managing projects, originally popularized by Toyota in the 1980s for supply chain management. Projects are represented by boards, which contain lists (corresponding to task lists). Lists contain cards (corresponding to tasks). Cards are supposed to progress from one list to the next (via drag-and-drop), for instance mirroring the flow of a feature from idea to implementation. Users can be assigned to cards. Users and boards can be grouped into organizations.

Trello has a variety of work and personal uses including real estate management, software project management, school bulletin boards, lesson planning, and law office case management. A rich API as well as email-in capability enables integration with enterprise systems, or with cloud-based integration services like IFTTT and Zapier.~\cite{wiki:trello}

\section{Technologies used in project}
Implementation of \textbf{Atomaddict} project was done in Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Database was created with SQLite engine.

%--------------------------------------------SUBSECTION--------------------------------------------
\subsection{Celery}
Celery is an open source asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.

The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on one or more worker nodes using multiprocessing, Eventlet or gevent. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously (wait until ready). Celery is used in production systems to process millions of tasks every hour.

Celery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented in any language. It can also operate with other languages using webhooks. There is also RCelery for the Ruby programming language, and a PHP client.
The recommended message broker is RabbitMQ, but support for Redis, MongoDB, Beanstalk, Amazon SQS, CouchDB, IronMQ and databases (using SQLAlchemy or the Django ORM) is also available.~\cite{wiki:celery}

%--------------------------------------------SUBSECTION--------------------------------------------
\subsection{RabbitMQ}
RabbitMQ is open source message broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The RabbitMQ server is written in the Erlang programming language and is built on the Open Telecom Platform framework for clustering and failover. Client libraries to interface with the broker are available for all major programming languages.

Rabbit Technologies Ltd., develops and provides support for RabbitMQ. Rabbit Technologies started as a joint venture between LShift and CohesiveFT in 2007, and was acquired in April 2010 by SpringSource, a division of VMware. The project became part of GoPivotal in May 2013.

The source code is released under the Mozilla Public License. The project consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item The RabbitMQ exchange server itself

    \item Gateways for HTTP, Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), and MQTT protocols

    \item  AMQP client libraries for Java, .NET Framework, and Erlang. (AMQP clients for other languages are available from other vendors.)

    \item A plug-in platform for custom additions, with a pre-defined collection of supported plug-ins, including:

        \begin{itemize}
        
            \item A `Shovel' plug-in that takes care of moving or copying (replicating) messages from one broker to another.

            \item A `Federation' plug-in that enables efficient sharing of messages between brokers (at the exchange level).

            \item A `Management' plug-in that enables monitoring and control of brokers and clusters of brokers.~\cite{wiki:rabbitmq}

        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Database}

\includegraphics{images/sqlite.png} \\

To store necessary information for \textbf{Attomaddict} was used SQLite database. The figure \ref{fig:databaseModel} provides a visual overview of the AttomAddict database and the realtions beetwen the tables. Table \ref{tab:tablesOverwiew} and \ref{tab:tableDetails} include additional details on the tables and columns.

\subsubsection{Implementation}

\includegraphics{images/sqla.png}

Database was made in python using SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. It provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.~\cite{wiki:sqlalchemy}

\subsection{Database package}

Database package is used for management database. It consists of different modules.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{model.models.py}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{description:} The data that is stored in the database is represented by a collection of classes. The ORM layer is doing translations required to map objects created from these classes into rows in the proper database table. The \texttt{\_\_init\_\_.py} file in package \texttt{model} connects database into flask application.
		
		\item \textbf{classes:} User, Settings, Tag, Website, Article.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \texttt{db\_repository} package 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{description:} Following versions of database model are stored in that file providing easy access to them.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \texttt{db\_create.py}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{description:} Module used to create database. Type and location of the database are stored in \texttt{config.py} in that package.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \texttt{db\_migrate.py}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{description:} Any changes to the database model can be incorporated into the database by executing this module. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \texttt{db\_upgrade.py}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{description:} This script allows the database to be upgraded to the latest revision, by applying the migration script stored in the database repository.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \texttt{db\_downgrade.py}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{description:} This script allows the database to be downgraded one revision.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \texttt{session.py}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{description:} Changes to a database are done in the context of a session. It allows easy access to database resources, it is adding, deleting, or changing records.
		\item \textbf{classes:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \texttt{Put} - adding resources to the database
			\item \texttt{Get} - getting resources from the database 
			\item \texttt{Delete} - deleting resources from the database
			\item \texttt{Add} - connecting relationships between tables - e.g. adding tag to user
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{methods:} They provide methods for changing user's settings or list of tags. They allow to get tags, articles or settings as a dictionary for easy use in html files. \\
		Example methods:
		\begin{itemize}
